Pivot Infrastructure

Initial access activity originated from an endpoint associated with SoftEther VPN service,
consistent with Salt Typhoon's known use of SoftEther for infrastructure obfuscation.
Trend Micro's Earth Estries IOC list also documents SoftEther VPN nodes in both Campaign Alpha and Beta.
